# Brave Search

Web search and content extraction using the official Brave Search API. No browser required.

## Setup

Requires a Brave Search API account with a free subscription. A credit card is required to create the free subscription (you won't be charged).

1. Create an account at https://api-dashboard.search.brave.com/register
2. Create a "Free AI" subscription
3. Create an API key for the subscription
4. Add to your shell profile (`~/.profile` or `~/.zprofile` for zsh):
   ```bash
   export BRAVE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```
5. Install [Deno](https://deno.com/) if it is not already available. Dependencies are fetched automatically on first use.

## Search

```bash
{baseDir}/search.ts "query"                         # Basic search (5 results)
{baseDir}/search.ts "query" -n 10                   # More results (max 20)
{baseDir}/search.ts "query" --content               # Include page content as markdown
{baseDir}/search.ts "query" --freshness pw          # Results from last week
{baseDir}/search.ts "query" --freshness 2024-01-01to2024-06-30  # Date range
{baseDir}/search.ts "query" --country DE            # Results from Germany
{baseDir}/search.ts "query" -n 3 --content          # Combined options
```

### Options

- `-n <num>` - Number of results (default: 5, max: 20)
- `--content` - Fetch and include page content as markdown
- `--country <code>` - Two-letter country code (default: US)
- `--freshness <period>` - Filter by time:
  - `pd` - Past day (24 hours)
  - `pw` - Past week
  - `pm` - Past month
  - `py` - Past year
  - `YYYY-MM-DDtoYYYY-MM-DD` - Custom date range

## Concurrent Searches

Searches from the same Linux/macOS user are serialized by a local PID lock to respect Brave's one-request-per-second free-plan limit. Waiting processes report lock status to stderr once per second. Dead owners and locks older than 30 seconds are reclaimed automatically. The executable grants Deno permission to run only POSIX `kill`, used as `kill -0` to check whether the owner still exists.

## Extract Page Content

```bash
{baseDir}/content.ts https://example.com/article
```

Fetches a URL and extracts readable content as markdown.

## Output Format

```
--- Result 1 ---
Title: Page Title
Link: https://example.com/page
Age: 2 days ago
Snippet: Description from search results
Content: (if --content flag used)
  Markdown content extracted from the page...

--- Result 2 ---
...
```

## When to Use

- Searching for documentation or API references
- Looking up facts or current information
- Fetching content from specific URLs
- Any task requiring web search without interactive browsing
